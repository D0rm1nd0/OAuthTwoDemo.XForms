### A simple demo of Xamarin.Auth in Xamarin.Forms

This demo does not cover pulling back any profile data (or any other data) from your given auth provider's API (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google, etc, etc, etc), but it will get you authenticated. After authentication, it's up to you to make subsequent calls against your chosen API with the token you received from a successful authentication.
